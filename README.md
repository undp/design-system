# United Nations Development Programme Design system

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create unified user interfaces for UNDP by the designer and developers. 

These projects will have consistent look and feel and accessible in nature by just following the guidelines in the documentation.  

By unifiying design elements into reusable components, development will simplify and accelerate the development of these digital products.

The Guide is a living document created to meet the needs of UNDP's front-end developers and designers. If there is a Component or Pattern that you need, or you have any other feedback, question or comment please contact us.
