<h1>Scrollbar</h1>
<p>The Scrollbar component defines a scroll on a div or a container when the information is too long.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>A scrollbar is a bar usually present at the extreme right or at the bottom of the window. It is used to move the page contents up and down or left and right so that the information on the entire page is visible.</p>

<h4>When to use:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>When the contents of the page are hidden and need scrolling.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Formatting</h3>

<h4>Default</h4>
<p>The Scrollbar is a small rectangular bar and the color of the bar shows the position of the content on the page.</p>

<h3>Behaviors</h3>
