# Loader
A loading spinner is a utility that shows a loading page overlay when clicking a link or button

### Overview
A loading spinner displays a loading page overlay to inform the user of some background activity happening in response to their action on a page. This helps the user understand that they need to wait for the activity to finish before proceeding further.

#### When to use:
- To inform the user that some background activity is happening when they encounter a delay in response to a button or link click.

### Formatting

#### Default
The loading spinner is a simple animation that informs the user that the page is loading. It will be displayed until the full page has been loaded.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Loading">
    <Loader></Loader>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Content
The loading spinner is a simple circle animation. The size varies depending on the screen size.

### Behaviors

#### States
The loading spinner has just one state - spinning. As soon as the page loads, the loading spinner is removed
