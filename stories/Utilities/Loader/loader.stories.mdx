# Loader
A loading spinner is a utility that shows a loading page overlay when clicking a link or button

### Overview
A loading spinner displays a loading page overlay to inform the user of some background activity happening in response to their action on a page. This helps the user understand that they need to wait for the activity to finish before proceeding further.

#### When to use:
- To inform the user that some background activity is happening when they encounter a delay in response to a button or link click

### Formatting

#### Default
The loading spinner is a simple animation that informs the user that the page is loading. It will be displayed until the full page has been loaded.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Loader">
    <Loader ></Loader>;
  </Story>
</Canvas>
