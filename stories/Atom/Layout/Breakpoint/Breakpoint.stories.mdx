# Breakpoints

The Breakpoints are the points at which the content of the website adapts itself as per the user’s device width.

### Overview
The Breakpoint components are defined to manage the layout of the website according to the device’s resolution with gutter spacing for left or right margins. The design system uses a mobile-first approach which means styles are applied first to mobile devices. Advanced styles and other overrides for larger screens are then added to the stylesheet via media queries.
 
#### When to use:
 - To make the content of the website adaptable to the user’s device resolution.
