          <h1>Authors</h1>

            <p>The author component gives an overview of the authors of an article/photo.</p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>

            <p>The Author component highlights the author(s)’s name, designation, and photo for an article or story they have contributed to on the site.</p>

            <h4>When to use:</h4>

            <p>The author component is primarily used to give credit to any article or story they have published on the site.</p>

            <h3>Formatting</h3>

            <h4>Default</h4>

            <p>The author component consists of a single author or multiple authors. If the author has a profile picture, it is displayed as follows:</p>

            <p>If the author does not have a profile photo or more authors are contributing to a single article/photo, then their information is displayed as follows:</p>

            <h4>Multiple authors</h4>

            <p>If there are up to 3 authors, they are displayed horizontally.</p>

            <p>If there are 4 or more authors, their profile pictures are not displayed.</p>

            <p>On smaller devices, the authors are stacked vertically if there are less than 4.</p>

            <p>If there are more than 4 authors, on smaller screens, they are displayed as follows:</p>

            <h3>Content</h3>

            <p>The author component contains the first and last name, profile picture (optional), and designation of the author(s).</p>

            <h3>Behaviors</h3>

            <h4>States</h4>

            <p>The author component will have a minimum of 1 author and can expand to as many authors as needed. There can be combinations of authors with or without profile photos.</p>

            <p>The following behavior modifiers are available:</p>

            <Canvas>
              <Story name="Author">
                {(args, { globals: { locale } }) => {
                  const caption = getCaptionForLocale(locale);
                  return (
                    <Author
                      authorImage={authorImage}
                      alt="Headshot of XYZ"
                      data={caption}
                      {...args}
                  ></Author>
                  );
                }}
              </Story>
            </Canvas>
