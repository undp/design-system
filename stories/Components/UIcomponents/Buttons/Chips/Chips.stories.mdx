# Buttons and Labels

A button describes what action will be performed when a user clicks or touches it. 

### Overview
A button describes the call to action that will be performed when the user clicks/touches it. It has a label and an optional animation. 

#### When to use:

- Buttons should be used as primary or secondary calls to actions
- Ideally, a page should have one or two primary buttons only. Other call-to-actions should be shown as secondary buttons
- Examples of buttons can be to “VIEW MORE” or “READ MORE” or “SIGN UP”
- If there are multiple choices for an action item, one default button should be active and the other buttons inactive

### Formatting 

#### Default
There are multiple button types in our design system
1. Primary button with arrow and without arrows
2. Secondary buttons without the arrow
3. CTA links with and without expanding arrows
4. Chips

### Content
