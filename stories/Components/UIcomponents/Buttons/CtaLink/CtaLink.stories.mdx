# Buttons and Labels

A button describes what action will be performed when a user clicks or touches it. 

### Overview
A button describes the call to action that will be performed when the user clicks/touches it. It has a label and an optional animation. 

#### When to use:

- Buttons should be used as primary or secondary calls to actions
- Ideally, a page should have one or two primary buttons only. Other call-to-actions should be shown as secondary buttons
- Examples of buttons can be to “VIEW MORE” or “READ MORE” or “SIGN UP”
- If there are multiple choices for an action item, one default button should be active and the other buttons inactive

### Formatting 

#### Default
There are multiple button types in our design system
1. Primary button with arrow and without arrows
2. Secondary buttons without the arrow
3. CTA links with and without expanding arrows
4. Chips

### Content

### Behaviors

#### States
CTA Link:
The CTA link with the arrow prompts the users to take action. and is in default state but the arrow does not expand.

The CTA links with the arrow in the hover state which changes its appearance once the mouse hovers over it but the arrow does not expand.

The CTA link with space expand in default state is a space expand link where the space after the text expands but the arrow does not. 

The CTA link with the arrow expand is in a hover state. When the mouse hovers over the link the text changes its appearance and the arrow expands.
