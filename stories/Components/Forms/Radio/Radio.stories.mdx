# Radio
A radio button is a utility that allows the user to select a single option from a set of options by clicking on the button.

### Overview
A radio button is a type of indicator which informs the user to choose a single option among the available set of options. If a radio button is selected and the user clicks on another radio button, then the previous one gets deselected.

#### When to use:
- When the user needs to select a single option.
- When the user needs to deselect an option.

### Formatting
#### Default
The radio button is a circular button and it is displayed beside each option which can be selected. 

### Content
The radio button is circular shaped. The color and the space inside the circle indicates if the option is selected or not. 

### Behaviors
#### States
The radio button has default, active and hover states which indicates that an option is to be selected or already selected.

The following behavior modifiers are available:
1. **Default state:**
  A Red circular button with white space indicates the default state where a user can select an option.
2. **Active state:**
  A Red circular button with a dot indicates the active state in which an option is already selected by the user.
3. **Hover state:**
  A Light Red circular button with white space indicates the hover state which changes appearance when the mouse hovers over it.
