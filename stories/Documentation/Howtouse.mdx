# How to use our design system?

Using the UNDP design system is very simple. To use the design system you need to follow these steps and also you need to have an exact component on your application.

### Steps to integrate

- Browse the component which you want to integrate.
- Check out the documentation page of the component.
- Copy the HTML of the component in your project.
- Check out the CSS and JS reference section in the document.
- Use the CSS and JS on your project as suggested.
- Follow [Internationalisation](?path=/docs/getting-started-internationalization--docs) guidelines to add support for additional languages.
