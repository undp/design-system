# Introduction

The purpose of this project is to create unified user interfaces for UNDP by the designer and developers.

These projects will have a consistent look and feel and are accessible by just following the guidelines in the documentation.

By unifying design elements into reusable components, the development will simplify and accelerate the development of these digital products.

The Guide is a living document created to meet the needs of UNDP's front-end developers and designers. If there is a Component or Pattern that you need, or you have any other feedback, question or comment please contact us.

### Structure

UNDP’s design system uses an atomic design approach. Within the seven thematic groups, each group is further organized by atomic level.
