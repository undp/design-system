	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		The purpose of this project is to create unified user interfaces for UNDP by the designer and developers.
	</p>
	<p>
		These projects will have consistent look and feel and accessible in nature by just following the guidelines in the documentation.
	</p>
	<p>
		By unifiying design elements into reusable components, development will simplify and accelerate the development of these digital products.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Guide is a living document created to meet the needs of UNDP's front-end developers and designers. If there is a Component or Pattern that you need, or you have any other feedback, question or comment please contact us.
	</p>
	<h2>Structure</h2>
	<p>
		UNDP’s design system uses an atomic design approach. Within the seven thematic groups, each group is further organized by atomic level.

	<h2>Codebase</h2>
	<p>
		For developers looking to build with UNDP’s design system it will soon be available as a StorybookJS package. All front-end code (HTML/CSS/JS) will be architected in a modular and scalable way.
